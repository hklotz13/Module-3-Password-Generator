# Module-3-Password-Generator
!(./assets/Password-Generator-Image.png)
This is a repo containing the code for Module 3's challenge, a random password generator. The password generator prompts the user for a character length, then asks the user to confirm whether or not they want a series of character types in their password. If the user does not specify length, the page is reloaded. If the user does not confirm any character types, the page also reloads. The final randomly generated password is then displayed in the text area on the page.
